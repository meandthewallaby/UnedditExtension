title: UnedditReddit No Longer Viable
---
Just wanted to post to explain why this hasn't been updated in a little while. UnedditReddit went to a for-pay only service, and changed their API. Also, Reddit has decided to remove identifying information from deleted comments (really, a bright move). Therefore, this extension is all but useless. I don't know how it works with the API if you've in fact paid, but it only uses the protocol that you're browsing Reddit with, so beware browsing via http.

Thanks to all who helped on the extension and all the kind feedback. It was very much appreciated!
